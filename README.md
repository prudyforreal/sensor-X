# sensor-X

OBJECTIVE: This project is a simple motion detection and alert system built using an ArduinoUno and a PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor. The PIR sensor detects movement within its range and sends a signal to the Arduino. When motion is detected, the system activates the red LED and the buzzer, which provides a visual and audible alert. When no movement is detected, the green LED indicates a safe state.

TOOLS USED: Arduino uno, PIR sensor, buzzer, breadboard, two resistors (330 ohms), two LED bulbs, 

BENEFITS/ USES  

1. Home Security Systems
•	Detects movement in a room, hallway, or near entrances.
•	Can trigger alarms, lights, or even send alerts when someone enters unexpectedly. 

2. School or Public Building Safety

•	It can be placed in restricted areas to detect unauthorized entry after hours.
•	Could trigger an alarm or notify security personnel.
